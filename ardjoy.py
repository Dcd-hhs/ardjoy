TODO:
    - Get the serial stream of data
      - Connect to serial
      - Receive data
        - decode data
    - Plot the joydata in a 'live' plot with matplotlib
      - get matplotlib to work with live data
        - stuff..
    - Genereate live data through another source, and modify the plot settings
      using the joydata
    - change to gitlab?

DONE:
